# Assistant Bots

Assistant bots are AI-powered tools that can help you interact with your data in a more intuitive way. They can understand natural language queries and translate them into SQL queries, making it easier for you to retrieve and manipulate data.

In Alchemy AI, we have several assistant bots, each with their own unique capabilities and specialties. They are designed to help you navigate your database, answer your questions, and even learn from your feedback to improve over time.

To use an assistant bot, simply type your query in the chat interface. The bot will understand your query, translate it into SQL, and execute it on your database. You can ask the bot to perform various tasks, such as retrieving data, inserting new data, updating existing data, and deleting data.

Remember, the assistant bots are here to help you. Don't hesitate to ask them anything. They are always ready to assist you!
